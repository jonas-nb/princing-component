## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   CSS Grid
-   Mobile-first workflow
-   [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - css-in-JS - For Styles
-   [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
-   [Styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) - For Styles

### What I learned

I was able to learn how to customize a range type input, even putting a background in it, that was the biggest challenge.


```css
input[type='range']::-webkit-slider-thumb {
    background-image: url('../../assets/images/icon-slider.svg');
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    background-size: 2rem;
    background-position: center;
}
```


### Continued development

This challenge served to show weaknesses in styled components, other than that it proved to be very easy to solve.

### Useful resources

useful resources 1 - put a size on the parent element for better grid control.
useful resources 2 - search stackoverflow to save timeuseful 
useful resources 3 - use more js with styled-components
